# Taciturn-Chrome
Taciturn-Chrome is a chrome extension to perform passive analysis of the
security of a website.  It doesn't alter the behavior of browsing a website,
but can alert on possible misconfigurations that can be security-sensitive.

## Developer Installation

2. Make sure the 'Developer Mode' checkbox is selected in the right hand
   corner.
3. Select 'Load unpacked extension...' and select the root folder of this
   project, taciturn-chrome.

## Uninstallation

comorbid false-positives generated by taciturn-chrome, you will want to
uninstall the chrome extension.  You can do this via the following steps.

1. In a chrome browser navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Find taciturn-chrome and click the garbage can icon.
3. Confirm you wish to remove taciturn-chrome.
